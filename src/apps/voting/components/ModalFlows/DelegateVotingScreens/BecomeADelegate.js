        Allow other people to delegate their voting power to your account so you
        can cast votes on their behalf. You can do this by simply sharing your
        Ethereum address with them.

        Once voters delegate their voting power to your account, you can choose
        if you wish to cast your vote with the total voting power, a % of it, or
        only yours. Keep in mind that voters can override your decision at any
        time.
